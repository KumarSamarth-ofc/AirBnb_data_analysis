   - Analyzed the distribution of Airbnb listing prices to identify pricing trends and outliers.

2. **How are different room types distributed?**
   - Examined the frequency of different room types (e.g., Entire home/apartment, Private room, Shared room).

3. **How are listings distributed across different neighborhoods?**
   - Explored the geographical distribution of listings to identify popular and less common areas.

4. **What is the relationship between price and room type?**
   - Investigated how room type influences price and identified pricing patterns for different categories.

5. **How has the number of reviews changed over time?**
   - Analyzed review trends over time to understand booking patterns and customer engagement.

## Tools & Libraries Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Data Source:
- The dataset was sourced from Airbnb's open data repository or a publicly available dataset.

## Results & Insights:
- Price distribution showed significant variation, with some high-end listings creating long tails.
- Entire homes/apartments were the most expensive, followed by private rooms and shared rooms.
- Listings were concentrated in key neighborhoods, with some areas having significantly higher density.
- Review counts fluctuated over time, reflecting seasonal trends and market dynamics.

## Conclusion:
This analysis provides insights into Airbnb listing patterns, helping both hosts and guests understand the market better. Future work could include deeper time-series analysis, sentiment analysis of reviews, and predictive modeling of pricing trends.
